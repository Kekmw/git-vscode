  statues. he is asked to choose a statue
  to live near.

> Kek: Just have the spawning be in a spawn area where there's lecterns to let the new player know everything and 5 pressure plates

# |warriors|

> Can't we alter it so that each statue has their own unique class so 1 is a brewer, 1 is a warrior, 1 is a hunter, 1 is a barbarian, and 1 is an assassin ;)
> Each trial should be fitted with the themed class their statue is so assassin statue would do mind puzzle and warriors and barbarians are fighting trials hunter is a marksman trial and brewer is a brewing trial

- each statue comprises of a `warrior`
  warriors hold artifacts gifted by the
  statues, each statue has a unique ability
  warriors have the power to wage wars.

- a warrior is chosen by a `trial`,
  players who have found the hidden trial
  under each statue can attempt it and the
  first one to finish it can aqquire the artifacts
  which can either aid them in combat or help in
  their economy.

- residents of a statue can wage a battle against
  the warrior to take his place and can aqquire the
  artifact upon defeating him.

# |economy|

- once a player makes it to the center kingdom
  he can find shops to sell and buy in.

- money can be obtained by selling resources only
  in the center kingdom.

- each statue can have their own shops to sell goods.
